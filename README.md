# imageMover
This script automates the act of moving images from one directory to another based on a .csv list of strings. 

Purpose & outputs: 

The script will print out the number of successful image moves (i.e. successful moves / total images meant to be moved) in the commandline. 
All images that aren't moved will be written to a .txt file in the image destination folder (as defined in the .bat file). 

Requirements to run:

	1. the filenames in the mislabeledPhotos.csv must be in the first column of a comma-delimited.csv file with NO HEADER
	2. the .bat file MUST be in the same folder as the .py script (as it is now).
	

Enjoy!
